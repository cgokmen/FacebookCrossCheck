# FacebookCrossCheck
A small Java app that allows you to cross-check the members of multiple groups

Check the source code of the [main class](src/com/cemgokmen/facebookcrosscheck/FacebookCrossCheck.java) to figure out what you need to do to run it.

To summarize, put in your access token (get one from the [Facebook Graph API explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/) and paste it) and put in the groups you want to check in the set.

Good luck!
